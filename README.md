# Mohammed Furqan Mehboob 

##Hello! I am a undergraduate student at the University of ##Texas at Austin majoring in Psychology with a minor in ##Computer Science. 

I am from Texas and I believe that psychology and computer science can come together to lead to important discoveries. These discoveries can hopefully one day make the world a better place. This is indeed a daunting task, but hardwork will make this a reality.
